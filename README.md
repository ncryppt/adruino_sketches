# Arduino

This is my arduino repo where I am documenting my learning. Feel free to use my code & projects in this repo. Below I will explain each individual file. 
Note these are programs made to run on arduino devices on the arduino IDE. The programs running on the device's are reffered to as "sketches" in the arduino community.

I am using a Arduino Uno R3 board. These files should work on all Arduino devices. Note pin placement & numbers may vary.

## Contents

1) Blink simple (blink_simple.ino)
2) Blink External board pin 12 (blink_pin12_externalboard.ino)

### 1- BLINK SIMPLE

This sketch is a great first sketch to do. Simply plug a LED (2 prong +/-) into digital port 13 (long end) and the short end into the digital ground. 
Then plug the arduino board via USB & access Arduino IDE on your computer. Paste the blink_simple.ino code into the IDE, click verify & then upload.
Your LED should be blinking!
